= Ansible Rulebook

In this section, you'll learn the following:

* [x] Understand Ansible Rulebook and _EDA_ (Event-Driven Ansible)
* [x] Run an Ansible task when an event is triggered
* [x] Run Playbook stored in a Git repository

[#rulebookeda]
== Ansible Rulebook and EDA

Event-Driven Ansible (_EDA_) is designed for simplicity and flexibility.
With _EDA_, you subscribe to an event listening source (i.e., a WebHook, Kafka Event, watchdog, ...). When an event occurs in one of these sources, it triggers an event to the _EDA_ server notifying the change, making Ansible react by running an action.
This action could be running an Ansible action, or start the execution of a playbook, or run a module directly, or sending another event.

[#firstrulebook]
== First Rulebook

A rulebook is a YAML file configuring the Ansible server, what events to flag and how to respond to them. 
These rulebooks are similar to Ansible Playbooks, but one difference you'll find is the _If-this-then-that_ coding.

A rulebook is composed of three significant elements:

Sources:: Define which event source is listening and reacting. Some examples: are webhooks, Kafka, Azure service bus, file changes, or alertmanager. 
Rules:: Define conditionals to match the event source. 
Actions:: what needs to be executed when a condition is met. 

=== Create a Rulebook

Let's start with a simple Rulebook that waits until Github triggers a webhook due to a push in a repository.
When Ansible receives the event, it will print some information from the request (HTTP headers and some body parts of the JSON body content).

In your working directory, create a new directory named `eda`:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
mkdir eda
cd eda
----

Then create a `rulebook-debug.yaml` file containing the Ansible EDA server definition (_source_), _rules_ on when to show the content, and finally, the _action_ of displaying the content on the terminal.

[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.eda/rulebook-debug.yaml
----
---
- name: Capture POSTs from GitHub
  hosts: all
  sources:
    - ansible.eda.webhook: # <1>
        host: 0.0.0.0
        port: 5000
      filters:
        - ansible.eda.dashes_to_underscores: # <2>

  rules:
    - name: Print Important Data
      condition: event.meta.headers.X_GitHub_Event == "push" # <3>
      action:
        echo: # <4>
          message: "A change in {{ event.meta.headers.X_GitHub_Event }} in repo {{event.payload.repository.name}} URL {{event.payload.repository.clone_url}}." # <5>
----
<1> Source is a webhook. EDA server is listening at port 5000
<2> Body content is filtered changing dashes to underscores
<3> HTTP Header request must contains `X-GitHub-Event` key with value `push` to execute the action
<4> The action is printing a message to terminal
<5> EDA parses JSON content and you can access it through `event.<fields>`

Create an inventory file registering only the local machine; in this case, no remote machine is used, but of course, you could also register it.
In the example, we use the YAML format instead of the INI format used xref:02-getting-started.adoc#inventory[previously].

[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.eda/inventory.yaml
----
all:
  hosts:
    localhost:
      ansible_connection: local
----

=== WebHook

We must create a new GitHub repository and configure the WebHooks to access the EDA server.
To simplify things and avoid connection problems (like accessing `localhost` from the public network), we'll simulate the event's trigger.

Create a JSON file containing the GitHub body content, it's sent as a webhook in case of a push into a repository.
Copy the following content to `webhook_git_push_payload_example.json` file:

[.console-input]
[source, json,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.eda/webhook_git_push_payload_example.json

Now, we can start Ansible EDA server and simulate the trigger of a GitHub push event.

=== Start EDA

In the `eda` directory, run the following command to start Ansible EDA.

IMPORTANT: If not set before, remember to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.

Run the following command in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ansible-rulebook -i inventory.yaml --rulebook rulebook-debug.yaml
----

At this point, Ansible EDA is started and waiting for incoming HTTP requests.

=== Trigger the event

Let's send an HTTP request simulating a push in a GitHub repository in a new terminal window.
Remember that the content is the same as you would receive in the case of a GitHub webhook; we are just simulating it for simplicity.

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -H 'X-GitHub-Event: push' -H 'X-GitHub-Event-Type: push' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data "@./webhook_git_push_payload_example.json" 127.0.0.1:5000/endpoint
----

Notice that the hostname is the `localhost` at port `5000` and the path is `endpoint`.

After the execution of the command, inspect the terminal where Ansible EDA is running, and you should see the echoed message:

[.console-output]
[source, terminal,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
2023-03-02 12:49:49.594794 : A change in push in repo ansible-eda-deepdive URL https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/ansible-eda-deepdive.git
----

With the Hello World example up and running, let's move the example forward to do something more useful.
Stop the instance doing a kbd:[Ctrl+C] on the terminal.

[#executingplaybooksfromgit]
== Executing Playbooks stored at a Git repo

After running a simple example, let's complicate things a bit more.
We'll implement a GitOps pipeline to react to a change in a playbook.

For example, when updating an application version in production, we might need to modify a playbook to set the new version and then apply the playbook.

One way of doing this is changing and applying the playbook manually, but doing it manually is a slow process, subject to error, and not reproducible.

So a better way would be to store the playbook in the Git repository, and when a change is done, automatically apply the change and propagate it to the environments.

Let's implement this use case using Ansible EDA.

=== Overview of the Process

The idea of what to do is easy, but all the required steps to run it are complex and need several actions.
Let's summarize the process:

. Extract the _event type_, _repository name_, _clone url_, and _git ref_ of the commit from the request, and store them in Ansible _facts_ (~variables).
. Print the extracted information.
. Run a playbook to clone the remote Git repository with the change to the Ansible EDA machine.
. Run the playbook defined in the Git repository
. Wipeout the workspace

=== The Remote Git repository

The repository is located at https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/ansible-eda-deepdive.git and contains a simple `deployment.yaml` file.

image::gh.png[]

And the content of the `deployment.yaml` file is an Ansible playbook that prints a message to configured host.

[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.deployment.yaml
----
---
- hosts: all
  tasks:
  - name: Print Hello World
    debug: msg="Hello World"
----

We don't need to do anything at this section, it's main purpose is showing you the layout of the repository.

IMPORTANT: Although this playbook is simple, everything valid in Ansible playbook is valid here.

=== Create the Rulebook

Now, it's time to write the rulebook with all the steps explained in <<Overview of the Process>>.
Creates a new file named `ansible-gitops.yaml` in the `eda` directory.

Although this file is not big, it contains some critical pieces that are better to see individually.
At the end of the section, we'll see the whole file with all the pieces together.

==== Extracting fields

In the Ansible rulebook, there is an action named `set_fact` used to store facts of the events.
In this case, we store the body information required to clone the repository locally:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.ansible-gitops.yaml
----
---
- name: Capture POSTs from gitea
  hosts: all
  sources:
    - ansible.eda.webhook: # <1>
        host: 0.0.0.0
        port: 5000
      filters:
        - ansible.eda.dashes_to_underscores:

  rules: # <2>
    - name: Create facts
      condition: event.payload is defined # <3>
      action:
        set_fact: # <4>
          fact: # <5>
            event_type: "{{ event.meta.headers.X_GitHub_Event }}"
            repository_name: "{{ event.payload.repository.name }}"
            clone_url: "{{event.payload.repository.clone_url}}"
            git_ref: "{{event.payload.ref}}"
----
<1> Defines Ansible server configuration
<2> All rules are defined under this section
<3> Only executethe action if there is content in the request
<4> `set_fact` is the action to execute
<5> Extracts data under the `fact` namespace

==== Print the extracted information

We've seen this in the previous rulebook, so nothing new:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.ansible-gitops.yaml
----
    - name: Print Important Data
      condition: fact.event_type == "push" # <1>
      action:
        echo: # <2>
          message: "A change {{fact.event_type}} in {{fact.repository_name}} URL {{fact.clone_url}}."
----
<1> Uses `fact` namespace, and then the name of the fact
<2> `echo` action prints the message to the console

==== Clone the remote Git repository

To clone the repository, we'll create a playbook that clones the remote repository into a temporal directory.
Create a new playbook file named `onpush.yaml` in the `eda` directory with the following content:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.eda/onpush.yaml
----
---
- name: OnPush -- update application repo
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local # <1>
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:

  - name: OnPush -- Check if repo exists locally
    ansible.builtin.stat: # <2>
      path: "/tmp/{{ fact.repository_name  }}"
    register: repo_stat # <3>

  - name: OnPush -- Clone application repository to event ref
    when: repo_stat.stat.exists == false # <4>
    ansible.builtin.git: # <5>
      repo: "{{ fact.clone_url }}"
      dest: "/tmp/{{ fact.repository_name }}" # <6>
      clone: true
      update: true
      version: "{{ fact.git_ref | split('/') | last }}"
    register: repo_cloned # <7>

  - set_fact: # <8>
      cacheable: true
      repository_name: "{{fact.repository_name}}"
      repo_stat: "{{ repo_stat }}"
      cloned: "{{ repo_cloned }}"
----
<1> Executes command in the localhost using the system Python
<2> Checks if directory exists
<3> Stores the result in the `repo_stat` var
<4> If directory is not present
<5> Uses Git task to clone the project
<6> Clones the repository to `/tmp/<name_of_repo>`
<7> Stores the result in the `repo_cloned` var
<8> Sets facts for the following execution

Then at the rulebook, we need to run this playbook:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.ansible-gitops.yaml
----
    - name: Respond to push event
      condition: fact.repository_name == "ansible-eda-deepdive" and fact.event_type == "push" # <1>
      action:
        run_playbook: # <2>
          name: onpush.yaml 
          set_facts: true # <3>
----
<1> Only when the repo is the one expected
<2> Sets the action to `run_playbook`
<3> Executes the `onpush.yaml` with facts

==== Run the playbook defined in Git

Then, we must repeat the same process as in the previous section but run the cloned playbook.

[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.ansible-gitops.yaml
----
    - name: Run application deploy playbook
      condition: fact.cloned.failed == false # <1>
      action:
        run_playbook:
          name: /tmp/{{fact.repository_name}}/deployment.yaml # <2>
----
<1> If the repo is cloned
<2> Runs the playbook defined in the repository

==== Wipeout the workspace

Finally, let's clean the directory where the repository was cloned.
Create a playbook `clean.yaml` to implement the delete task:

[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.eda/clean.yaml
----
---
- name: Clean workspace
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: true
  tasks:

  - name: Clean Git directory
    ansible.builtin.file:
      path: /tmp/{{ fact.repository_name }}
      state: absent # <1>
----
<1> Deletes the directory

And finally it runs the playbook.

[.console-input]
[source, yaml,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.ansible-gitops.yaml
----
    - name: Clean workspace
      condition: fact.cloned.failed == false
      action:
        run_playbook:
          name: clean.yaml
          set_facts: true
----

==== Full `ansible-gitops.yaml` file

The full rulebook is shown in the following snippet:

  rules:
    - name: Create facts
      condition: event.payload is defined
      action:
        set_fact:
          fact:

            git_ref: "{{event.payload.ref}}"
          
    - name: Print Important Data
      condition: fact.event_type == "push"
      action:
        echo:
          message: "A change {{fact.event_type}} in {{fact.repository_name}} URL {{fact.clone_url}}."
    - name: Respond to push event
      condition: fact.repository_name == "ansible-eda-deepdive" and fact.event_type == "push"

          set_facts: true

    - name: Run application deploy playbook

      action:
        run_playbook:

    - name: Clean workspace
      condition: fact.cloned.failed == false
      action:
        run_playbook:

          set_facts: true

=== Start EDA

In the `eda` directory, run the following command to start Ansible EDA.

IMPORTANT: Remember to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable if not set before.

Run the following command in the terminal:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ansible-rulebook -i inventory.yaml --rulebook ansible-gitops.yaml
----

At this point, Ansible EDA is started and waiting for incoming HTTP requests.

=== Trigger the event

Let's send an HTTP request simulating a push in a GitHub repository in a new terminal window.
Remember that the content is the same as you would receive in the case of a GitHub webhook; we are just simulating it for simplicity.

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl -H 'X-GitHub-Event: push' -H 'X-GitHub-Event-Type: push' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data "@./webhook_git_push_payload_example.json" 127.0.0.1:5000/endpoint
----

Notice that the hostname is the `localhost` at port `5000` and the path is `endpoint`.

After the execution of the command, inspect the terminal where Ansible EDA is running, and you should see the echoed message:
