[#ansible]
== Setup Ansible

To install Ansible and all its toolset, use `pip`.
In a terminal window run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
sudo pip install ansible --upgrade
----

And check that ansible is installed:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ansible --version
----

[.console-output]
[source, terminal,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

[#preparingkeys]
== Preparing Keys

Ansible uses SSH to run commands against managed machines.
To login to these machines, you can use login/password, but the most common way is using public/private keys to login.

WARNING: In case of using Microsoft Windows, you might need to install https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui[OpenSSH client for Windows].

Let's create a pair of keys.
Run the following command in a terminal window:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ansible
----

[.console-output]
[source, terminal,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Passphrases do not match.  Try again.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/asotobu/.ssh/id_rsa_ansible
Your public key has been saved in /Users/asotobu/.ssh/id_rsa_ansible.pub
----

Validate the creation of the keys.

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ansible.pub
----

[.console-output]

[#bootingservers]
== Booting Servers

Ansible manages servers, and we need some servers to manage.
One option could be to prepare some virtual machines and starting them locally, but since these are heavy, we are providing a `docker-compose` file that starts two containers acting as a "virtual machines".

In a terminal window, go to `apps` directory and run the `docker-compose` command:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
docker-compose up --remove-orphans
----

[.console-output]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

----

See that each server is exposing SSH service in different ports, one to `2223` and the other one to `2224`.

The last step before we can start using Ansible is copying the public key into the servers, so we can login using the local private key generated in the last step.

In another terminal window run the following commands to copy the public key generated before.
The password to enyer is `mypassword`:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.Server One
----
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ansible -p 2223 root@localhost
----

[.console-oupt]
[source, terminal,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.Server One
----
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: 
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 keys remain to be installed if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
root@localhost s password:

Number of key(s) added:        1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh -p '2223' 'root@localhost'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
----

And do the same  with the other service which is in port `2224`.

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.Server One
----
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa_ansible -p 2224 root@localhost
----

[.console-oupt]

root@localhost s password:

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh -p '2224' 'root@localhost'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
