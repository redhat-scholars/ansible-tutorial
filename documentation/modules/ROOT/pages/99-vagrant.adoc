* [x] Installing Oracle VM VirtualBox and Vagrant
* [x] Boot up Virtual Machines using Vagrant

== Host and Guest machines

When using Virtual Machines there are two important concepts you need to be aware of, that is the *guest* and the *host* machine.

Host:: It's the physical machine where you install the operative system that managesthe computer. In thescope of this tutorial, it's your machine.
Guest:: It's the virtual machine that is installed, executed and hosted on the host physical machine.

== Oracle VM Virtual Box

https://www.virtualbox.org/[Oracle VM VirtualBox] is a type-2 hypervisor for x86 virtualization used in order to run virtual machines, on the local computer.

With VirtualBox can load multiple guest OSes under a single host operating-system (host OS).
Each guest can be started, paused and stopped independently within its own virtual machine.

To install VirtualBox, go to https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads[Virtual Box Download Page, window="_blank"], select your operative system package, and install it.

When installed, you don't need to start it, Vagrant will do it for you.

== Vagrant

https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments.

To install VirtualBox, go to https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads[Vagrant Download Page, window="_blank"], select your operative system package, and install it.

Open a new terminal and run the following command to validate that has been installed correctly:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
vagrant --version
----

[.console-output]
[source, terminal,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Vagrant 2.3.4
----

=== Vagrantfile

To define the virtual machines, Vagrant defines a `Vagrantfile` to configure the virtual machines, its network configuration, or the required resources.

Let's create a new file named `Vagrantfile` configuring two virtual machines (`staging`, `prod`) from a Fedora box, creating a public network to access the guest machine from the host machine:

[.console-input]
[source, ruby,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
.Vagrantfile
----
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|

  # <1>
  config.vm.define "staging" do |staging| 
    # <2>
    staging.vm.box = "fedora/37-cloud-base"
    staging.vm.box_version = "37.20221105.0"
    # <3>
    staging.ssh.password="vagrant"
    # <4>
    staging.vm.network "public_network", use_dhcp_assigned_default_route: true
    staging.ssh.forward_agent = true
    # <5>
    staging.vm.provision "shell", inline: "ip -4 -o a"
  end

  config.vm.define "prod" do |prod|
    prod.vm.box = "fedora/37-cloud-base"
    prod.vm.box_version = "37.20221105.0"
    prod.ssh.password="vagrant"
    prod.vm.network "public_network", use_dhcp_assigned_default_route: true
    prod.ssh.forward_agent = true
    prod.vm.provision "shell", inline: "ip -4 -o a"
  end

  # <6>
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.memory = "1024"
  end
end
----
<1> Defines the `staging` machine
<2> Sets Fedora box
<3> Sets password for SSH connection (username is `vagrant` by default)
<4> Configures a public network between guest and host (same IP space)
<5> Executes this shell script to get IP address
<6> Sets memory value for each machine

To start these machines, run the following command at the same directory as the `Vagrantfile`:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
vagrant up
----

And the output should be similar as the follows.
It's important to note that if you have more than one network adapter in your machine (i.e LAN and Wi-Fi), you'll need to choose in which network adapter IP space should be the machine assigned with.
Selectthe one with the Internet connection.

<1> Requests for the network interface
<2> Prints the list of assigned IPs for the machine

From the list of available IPs printed in the console, you need to choose the one in the same range as yor local machine.

If you are unsure which one is the valid, you only need to ping them (exclude `lo` interface of course) and the one returning succesfully is the public IP to access to the machine.

For example in my case and assuming the terminal output shown before:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ping 10.0.2.15
----

[.console-output]
[source, terminal,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
PING 10.0.2.15 (10.0.2.15): 56 data bytes
Request timeout for icmp_seq 0
Request timeout for icmp_seq 1
Request timeout for icmp_seq 2
----

It's not this one.
Let's try the following one:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ping 192.168.1.93
----

[.console-output]
[source, terminal,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
PING 192.168.1.93 (192.168.1.93): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.1.93: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.909 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.93: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.301 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.93: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.279 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.93: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.311 ms
----

There it is.

IMPORTANT: Change the IPs of the commands with the IPs printed in your terminal.

=== Testing the Connection

Last step before concluding that Ansible can interact with both virtual machines, is validating the SSH connection.
Let's connect using the previous IPs, with username `vagrant` and password `vagrant` to validate that we can login to both virtual machines.

IMPORTANT: Remember to put your IP when using SSH command.

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
ssh vagrant@192.168.1.92
----

[.console-output]
[source, terminal,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
The authenticity of host '192.168.1.92 (192.168.1.92)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:CW3D3uc0+i77Fmcwk5Iskdrr98d70ZCrq2HUBLLwmvM.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '192.168.1.92' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
[vagrant@localhost ~]$
----

And `exit` from the guest terminal.

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
exit
----

[.console-output]
[source, terminal,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
logout
Connection to 192.168.1.92 closed.
----

And *repeat* the operation with the other virtual machine.

=== Clean Up

When you finish the tutorial, you can stop the virtual machines using the following command:

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
vagrant halt
----

[.console-output]
[source, terminal,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
==> prod: Attempting graceful shutdown of VM...
==> staging: Attempting graceful shutdown of VM...
----

In case you plan to not use them anymore, run the `destroy` command.ç

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
vagrant halt
----

[.console-input]
[source, bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
==> prod: Attempting graceful shutdown of VM...
==> staging: Attempting graceful shutdown of VM...
❯ vagrant destroy
    prod: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'prod' VM? [y/N] y
==> prod: Destroying VM and associated drives...
    staging: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'staging' VM? [y/N] y
==> staging: Destroying VM and associated drives...
